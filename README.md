## Universal Executable (.exu)

**Universal Executables** are an architecture independent, strongly versioned, and statically sandboxed executable format that consists of a WebAssembly module combined with a compressed, read-only filesystem and transactional database.

#### Advantages

1. Fully self-contained, applications can't do things outside of their assigned castle walls.
2. Sandboxed without overhead.
3. Standardized, strongly versioned API
4. Architecture independent.



The format of .exu files is described in [format.md](format.md).
